# python-library-template
A template repository for pure Python modules developed at the University of Saskatchewan
Atmospheric Research Group (usask-arg) that are to be publicly developed on GitHub.

## Check list when creating a new repository

### Updating Files
After using this template, there are a few files which need to be updated.

`pyproject.toml`
 - Read through and update all fields in the `[project]` section

`conda.recipe/meta.yaml`
 - Update the `package:` section with the package name
 - Update the `tests: imports:` section with the package name
 - Look through the `about:` section and update accordingly

`src/usask_arg_example/__init__.py`
 - Remove the example function

`src/usask_arg_example`
 - Rename the `usask_arg_example` folder to the name of your project

`tests/test_example.py`
 - Delete this file, or rename and use for your own tests

`docs/source/conf.py`
 - Update lines 9 through 12 accordingly

`README.md`
 - Delete all contents above `# PROJECTNAMEHERE` and read through the remainder, updating accordingly

`LICENSE`
 - The default license is the MIT license, change this if you want a different license.  Also make sure to update the License section in the README

### Code releases
By default, every night at midnight the project is packaged and then uploaded to the `usask-arg-nightly` Anaconda page (https://anaconda.org/usask-arg-nightly),
in addition, every tagged release is uploaded to the `usask-arg` Anaconda page (https://anaconda.org/usask-arg).

If you want the package to be either uploaded to `pypi` or built on `conda-forge`, speak to @dannyzed

If you want to disable the uploading of packages to the `usask-arg` channels, delete the files

 - `.github/workflows/nightly.yml`
 - `.github/workflows/release.yml`

### Automatic Documentation Building
If you want your project documentation to be automatically built and hosted on readthedocs.org, ask @dannyzed.
If you do not want your documentation to be hosted on readthedocs.org you can delete the `.readthedocs.yaml` file.

## Adding dependencies
If you need to add a dependency to the project, it must be added in the following places

- `env.yml`
- `pypoject.toml`, the "dependencies" section
- `conda.recipe/meta.yaml`, the "requirements/run" section

## Updating Python versions
The template is configured to test the code on the latest three available Python versions.  These are defined in

- `pyproject.toml`
- `.github/workflows/test.yml`

## Releasing a New Package Version
To release an official version of the package, click on Releases on the home page of your project, then draft a new release.
Here, click on "Choose a tag" and name your tag `vX.Y.Z` where `X.Y.Z` is the version number.  For `usask-arg` projects we
recommend using Calendar Versioning (https://calver.org) which has the form `YYYY.MM.MICRO` where

- `YYYY` is the current year, e.g. 2024
- `MM` is the current month as a two element string, e.g. 08
- `MICRO` starts at 0 and increments by one each release that month.  The first release of 2024-08 would be `2024.08.0` and the second release would be `2024.08.1`

You can then write some release notes and make the release.
